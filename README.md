# Build a Game-playing Agent

![Example game of isolation](viz.gif)

## Synopsis

TODO Change this file

In this project, we develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation".  Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board.  Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game.  The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.  These rules are implemented in the `isolation.Board` class provided in the repository. 


## Game Visualization

The `isoviz` folder contains a modified version of chessboard.js that can animate games played on a 7x7 board.  In order to use the board, you must run a local webserver by running `python -m http.server 8000` from your project directory (you can replace 8000 with another port number if that one is unavailable), then open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and navigate to the `/isoviz/display.html` page.  Enter the move history of an isolation match (i.e., the array returned by the Board.play() method) into the text area and run the match.  Refresh the page to run a different game.  (Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements to isoviz.)
